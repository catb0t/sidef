# Considering quadratics of the form:

# n² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000

# where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
#   e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4

# Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
